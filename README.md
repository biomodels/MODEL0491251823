# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Vascular and perivascular nitric oxide release and transport: biochemical pathways of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3).**   
Chen K, Popel AS _Free Radic Biol Med._ 2007 Mar 15;42(6):811-22.

**Abstract:**   
Nitric oxide (NO) derived from nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is an important
paracrine effector that maintains vascular tone. The release of NO mediated by
NOS isozymes under various O(2) conditions critically determines the NO
bioavailability in tissues. Because of experimental difficulties, there has
been no direct information on how enzymatic NO production and distribution
change around arterioles under various oxygen conditions. In this study, we
used computational models based on the analysis of biochemical pathways of
enzymatic NO synthesis and the availability of NOS isozymes to quantify the NO
production by neuronal NOS (NOS1) and endothelial NOS (NOS3). We compared the
catalytic activities of NOS1 and NOS3 and their sensitivities to the
concentration of substrate O(2). Based on the NO release rates predicted from
kinetic models, the geometric distribution of NO sources, and mass balance
analysis, we predicted the NO concentration profiles around an arteriole under
various O(2) conditions. The results indicated that NOS1-catalyzed NO
production was significantly more sensitive to ambient O(2) concentration than
that catalyzed by NOS3. Also, the high sensitivity of NOS1 catalytic activity
to O(2) was associated with significantly reduced NO production and therefore
NO concentrations, upon hypoxia. Moreover, the major source determining the
distribution of NO was NOS1, which was abundantly expressed in the nerve
fibers and mast cells close to arterioles, rather than NOS3, which was
expressed in the endothelium. Finally, the perivascular NO concentration
predicted by the models under conditions of normoxia was paradoxically at
least an order of magnitude lower than a number of experimental measurements,
suggesting a higher abundance of NOS1 or NOS3 and/or the existence of other
enzymatic or nonenzymatic sources of NO in the microvasculature.
